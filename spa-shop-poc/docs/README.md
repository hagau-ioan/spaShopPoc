# spa-shop-poc

A modern Single Page Application built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind UI, RxDB, Redux Toolkit, and more.

## Features

- Next.js for server-rendered React applications
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind UI for styling
- RxDB for offline-first database
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

# More Details: Summary of Operations, Frameworks, and Libraries Used

## 1. Libraries & Tools:
   - **RxDB**: 
     - **`rxdb`** is a reactive NoSQL database used to store and manage data in the application. In your script, it was used to initialize and configure a local database.
     - **`getRxStorageDexie`**: A storage plugin for RxDB that provides browser storage support using **Dexie.js**.
   
   - **NextAuth.js**:
     - **`next-auth`** is used for handling authentication in a Next.js application.
     - **`CredentialsProvider`**: A provider to authenticate users with custom credentials (like username and password). In your script, it checks for hardcoded credentials (`username: 'user'`, `password: 'password'`).
   
   - **Redux Toolkit**:
     - **`createSlice`** is a function from Redux Toolkit used to create slices (pieces of Redux state). 
     - Slices help in managing the application state and dispatching actions (like `loading` and `error` in your slice example).
   
   - **TypeScript**:
     - TypeScript type annotations (like `interface`) are used to define strong types for the state (e.g., `AuthState`, `UserState`, etc.).
     - **Types for Redux**: TypeScript helps with ensuring type safety in Redux slices and other parts of the application.
   
   - **React**:
     - **React Components**: For UI components like `MainLayout.tsx`, which is a layout wrapper around child components.
     - **React JSX**: Used for rendering the HTML structure inside components like `MainLayout`.
   
   - **Tailwind CSS**:
     - **Utility-First CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS is used in your `MainLayout` for styling. For example, `className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100"` defines the background color and layout.

## 2. File Creation:
   The script generates TypeScript files (`.slice.ts`), Next.js authentication configurations (`nextauth.ts`), and layout components (`MainLayout.tsx`) for your SPA (Single Page Application).

## 3. Frameworks and Libraries Used:
   - **Next.js**: 
     - While not explicitly mentioned in the script itself, it's assumed that youâ€™re working with **Next.js** as the framework, given your use of **NextAuth.js** and the Next.js-style file structure (e.g., `src/features/auth/nextauth.ts`).
   
   - **RxDB**: A local database to store data on the client side, particularly useful in offline-first applications.
   
   - **Redux Toolkit**: For state management (creating slices, managing actions, reducers, and state).
   
   - **NextAuth.js**: For managing authentication in the Next.js app.
   
   - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for fast, responsive, and customizable styling of the UI components.
   
   - **React**: For the creation of reusable UI components, such as the `MainLayout`.

## Conclusion:
The shell script automates several tasks in setting up a **Next.js application** with the following tools and libraries:
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management with slices.
- **NextAuth.js** for handling user authentication.
- **RxDB** for managing offline storage with a reactive database.
- **React** for building UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling the components.

The script dynamically creates essential files for the project, sets up the authentication system, and handles state management for different features (auth, user, dashboard). The usage of **Bash scripting** ties everything together, automating file creation and configuration.
